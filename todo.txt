Current RoadMap:
    - figure out pagination
        -First find count of query
        -Count number of pages given query (total /25)
        - Display the first 25, on the bottom allow page selection
    - Look into what happens when you lowercase non-eng characters [test]
    - update keyword generation (make everything english lowercase)
    - update search (make everything english lowercase)
    - Upload the taiwan text
    - Update create page
        - Subjects fields
        - Reform Language fields
            - FOR BOTH ALLOW SOLIDIFYING SELECTIONS        
    - Fix Advanced search
        -doozy
    - allow users to update, delete
    - update Browser Icon
    - update site name
    - Display Missing fields at bottom of information
    - Quick citation button
    - Integrate firebase auth (watch webninja)
        - Display username at top right-hand side
    - make creating and deleting only auth users
    - Allow non-auth users to suggest additions

ToDo:
    - Languages:
    - Book Entry:
        - Make Entry Number Unique Key - x
    - Firebase Config:
        - Make firebase only accessible by verified users -- make self verified users
    - Home Page:
    - Search Page:
        - Make massive search functional
        - Look at JSTOR or other websites, take inspiration
    - Login:
        - Implement Login & users, allow only verified users to add Entries
    - BookDetails:
        - Allow user to edit/delete
    - Deployment:
        - Host on Netlify
        - Discuss domain w/ dad
    - OTHER ISSUES
        - keywords repeating: Set not functioning properly
        - Advanced search doesn't work (Can you do advanced search w/ firebase?)
        - Live Server Does Not Work (check firebase hosting/Netlify availability)
        - Replace Browser Icon
         
- Add Subjects
    - Multiple subjects allowed

- IDEA
    - Scan for languages w/ simple array matching -- include all allowed languages in array: throw error with unrecognized Language
- Types:
