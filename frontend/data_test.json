For example, Hou Hsiao-hsien's Pei-Ch’ing Cheng-Shih is used as a proper title while the English title, A City of Sadness, is provided as a reference title. Vol. 2, “Directors’ Filmography and Indexes” is categorized in four parts: 1) Directors’ filmography, 2) Directors by country, 3) Directors of animated film, and 4) Selected bibliography. 49 film directors are listed under “Taiwan” and each director’s films are listed in a corresponding filmography; for example, Hou Hsiao-hsien is presented with seven films, produced from 1983-1989, in his filmography. However, famous Taiwan director Li Xing (1930-) is listed as a Hong Kong film director, his name is misspelled “Li Hsin, 1931-”, and his limited filmography only contains works produced from 1965-1982.",

Chapter 1 focuses on Qiong Yao’s literary and melodramatic films during the 1970s, Chapter 2 deals with the Taiwan native (xiang tu) films represented by Li Xing and his films during the 1970s and 1980s, Chapter 3 describes Taiwan student films represented by Lin Qingjie, Ouyang Jun, and others, Chapter 4 comments on the unsuccessful development of kung fu film by Hong Kong film director King Hu, Chapter 5 and 6 describe the arrival of the Taiwan New Cinema represented by Hou Hsiao-hsien, Edward Yang, Wang Tung, and others during the 1980s, Chapter 7 laments Taiwan cinema’s decline in the 1990s, and Chapter 8 concludes with a description of the struggling Taiwan film industry at the beginning of the 2000s.The book reads more as a personal commentary and introduction to Taiwan film history for a general audience than as a serious academic work. Some arguments within the book are questionable, such as the author’s claim that kung fu film development in Taiwan was unsuccessful; in fact, Taiwan Kung Fu film production, initiated by King Hu and his film Longmen Ke Zhan (Dragon Gate Inn) 1967 was very successful in Taiwan. Based on statistics, during the first quarter of 1968, eight Taiwan kung fu films earned a box office income of more than 1 million Taiwan dollars. Not to mention, Taiwan film director Ang Lee’s kung fu film: Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) was also successful, winning various film awards throughout the world, including four Academy Awards. On the other hand, the author has devoted a complete chapter to discuss Taiwan student films, a topic that is not often the focus Taiwan film analyses.Includes a list of Golden Horse Award winning films and a Taiwan film chronology from 1973-2004, but there is neither a bibliography nor index.",

            "note": "According to the author’s preface and introduction to this Taiwanese-dialect film history, the title of the book should have been: Authentic History of Taiwanese-dialect Film; however, no explanation is provided to account for the change in title. Ye used Huang Ren’s 1994 work as a reference, yet integrates new perspectives, including the political, sociological and cultural; due to the author’s academic background, the text provides a scholarly approach to Taiwanese-dialect film history in contrast to Huang Ren’s work published earlier. The author suggests that the Taiwanese-dialect film movement lasted from 1955-1974, althrough there were a few attemps to revive its seemingly inevitable death from 1974-1981, while Huang Ren claims the movement ended in 1980. The filmography includes Taiwanese-dialect films produced from 1955-1981 and includes films not listed in Huang Ren’s work. Ye is critical of the KMT’s handling of the 2/28 Incident and the KMT government’s policy vis-à-vis Taiwanese-dialect film. Contains seven chapters with notes for each chapter.Includes film stills, posters, and photos.",

            "note": "A serious academic work that provides thorough research and original perspectives. As the first attempt to outline Chinese film history in English with an up-to-date and “chronological history” study approach, the author uses a “Chinese national cinema” paradigm to cover all films produced in mainland China (including those prior to 1949), Hong Kong and Taiwan, while at the same time instructing the reader to keep in mind all associated problematics and “messiness” -- theoretical as well as geopolitical -- surrounding “China” and “Chineseness”. Th text forms a “general and potentially comparative framework of Chinese national cinema” in the three territories of mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Unlike many other works on the same subject, it provides a unique historical perspective: “Cinema and national traditions, 1896-1929”, “Cinema and the nation-people, 1930-49”,  “Cinematic reinvention of the national in Taiwan, 1896-1978”,  “Cinematic revival of the regional in Hong Kong, 1945-78”, “Cinema and the nation-state in the PRC, 1949-78”, “Cinema and national/regional cultures, 1979-89”,  “Cinema and the transnational imaginary, 1990-2002”.  This is not a comprehensive history of Chinese cinema; the author states: “this book concentrates primarily on feature films”.Since the publisher does not print Chinese characters, the author reasonably used Pinyin unless names are more commonly recognized in Wade-Giles or Cantonese (for more information regarding this tactic, see the “Romanization and Name spelling” section at the beginning of this volume). Almost all Chinese film titles in the text and index are presented in their English translations, without romanization or Chinese characters.Includes Bibliography and Index.",

It is the most objective and comprehensive description of Chinese film history in terms of the photographic materials and range of subjects included in the book, but not in terms of in-depth academic exploration of the topics presented.It is a bilingual work of Chinese and English and is divided into four parts:  Chinese Cinema 1896-1949 (with separate chapters dealing with the beginnings of Chinese cinema in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan), Taiwan Cinema 1949-1999, Hong Kong Cinema 1949-1999, and Mainland Chinese Cinema 1949-1999.The text attempts to tackle controversial issues, such as the Japanese influence on cinema during the colonial period, government censorship in Taiwan, anti-communist propaganda films, and the February 28th Incident in 1947 in Taiwan. A comparative line of study connects Taiwan (and Japan during the colonial period), Hong Kong, and mainland China throughout the book.Unfortunately, apart from a short bibliography, there is no index for the incredibly rich film related materials, particularly the photographical materials, from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China.",

Describes the economic conditions and competition of Taiwanese-dialect films, and government film policies. In conclusion, the paper states that the following reasons lead to the eventual downturn of Taiwanese-dialect cinema: 1. Initially local filmmakers in Taiwan started to produce Taiwanese-dialect films due to a weak market of Mandarin films and stimulation of popular Xiamen-dialect films, 2. the quality of early Taiwanese-dialect films was poor and did not improve over time, even after its initial popular period, due to limited resources, 3. Taiwanese-dialect films inevitably lost their share of the market share when the Mandarin film industry emerged and Japanese films were banned, 4. government film policy and officials in Taiwan were always hostile to Taiwanese-dialect films and film-making.

This model represents a trend of cultural globalization and commodification in Taiwan film production. Appling the discourse of the New International Division of Cultural Labor (NIDCL) and the Global Film Market System in the case of Double Vision, the close connection between transnational film production and characteristics of Hollywood film production is evident.

Representation of violence and violence of representation; 3 Manipulation of reality through mediation and simulacra; 4. Relentless demolition driven by modernization and urbanization; 5. Erasure of individual memories by linear and masculinist history; and 6. Domination of the socioeconomic and political life by the cinematic mode of production” (20).

In the 1990s, Hollywood films flooded Taiwan’s theaters (in 1996, Hollywood films occupied 90% of Taiwan’s film market), at the same time, the Taiwan government, policy makers, scholars, and film workers tried to alleviate Taiwan’s film market slippage. Research reveals that Taiwan directors were featured in newspapers in terms of their achievements in receiving awards in international film festivals, the government film subsidies received by these directors, and the difficulties inherent to releasing films domestically -- unlike the Hollywood and Hong Kong newspaper reports that focused on film plots and promotional activities.The study recommends that newspapers present Taiwan domestic films with similar exposure as provided for Hollywood films.Inculdes Chinese & English Abstract, Bibliography, statistical charts of Taiwan domestic, Hong Kong, and foreign film distribution and box office records, 1996-2004.",

The book provides suggestions to the government regarding the establishment of complete and reasonable film laws and policies that would enable the best possible environment for the development of Taiwan's film industry. For example, the author recommends controlling the importation and distribution of foreign films in Taiwan due to the threat of American film distribution in Taiwan.  Suggestions are also made regarding Taiwan's filmmaking personnel by offering a comparative study of Japanese and Taiwan film development after WWII. The Appendix includes some important statistics, such as a filmography of Taiwan films produced from 1948-1967 (pp. 77-87), the annual ten best Mandarin films at the box office from 1957-1967 (pp. 78-96), and a statistical record of movie theatre attendance in the Taiwan area in 1967 (pp. 97-98).",

The text focuses on the relationship between film and Chinese society, folktales, legends, myth, opera, novels, and short-stories. The introduction’s subtitle is: “Family and Social Problems in Chinese Films Shown in Taiwan.” Includes abstracts of 329 films (pp. 41-223); film titles, presented in both Wade-Giles and Chinese characters, are followed by a synopsis and a note regarding screening locations and dates. Rather than using page numbers, the book’s general index references the text’s 329 film abstracts by their respective, sequentially assigned numbers.

Urban Space in Production and Disappearance, and Part IV. Biothics, Non-Anthropocentrism, and Green Sovereignty. In the text’s first chapter, “Framing ambient Unheimlich: Ecoggedon, Ecological Unconscious, and Water Pathology in New Chinese Cinema,” by Jiayan Mi, examines imagery of water in both post-Mao mainland China and post-Miracle Taiwan cinema and claims that “beneath these seemingly ecodystopian films lies New Chinese Ecocinema’s utopiamism of messianic redemption and elevated humanism.” In addition, chapter 6’s essay “Putting Back the Animals: Women-Animal Meme in Contemporary Taiwanese Ecofeminist Imagination,” by Cha-ju Chang, uses an ecofeminist critique of a woman-animal meme to analyze contemporary Taiwanese films and argues that this meme represents the overlapping oppression and exploitation of both women and animals.Includes Chinese Glossary, Filmography, Bibliography, and Index.",

Opera films were also the first productions in major regional language films, Cantonese (1933) and Taiwanese (1954).” Other Taiwan film or related comparative film studies essays include Meiling Wu’s “Postsadness Taiwan New Cinema: Eat, Drink, Everyman, Everywoman,” Emilie Yueh-yu Yeh’s “Poetics and Politics of Hou Hsiao-hsien’s Films,” Sheldon H.

The “foreign/er” is used as a framework and metaphor that facilitates the permutation of the varied and complex meanings of Taiwan New Cinema. Assesses how Taipei is the “city foreigner” in Edward Yang’s films, Lan Shengchun’s films explore the “mainlander-foreigner” dynamic, three films made by Chang Yi and his partner Yang Huishan present Yang’s body as a space where foreign and familiar forces become intertwined, and, as the most daring experimenter, Hou Hsiao-hsien pursues a very foreign form to present Taiwan stories in his films.Includes Bibliography.",

The editor admits, in the preface, that many Taiwan and Hong Kong film actors and actresses are not included due to limited contact with Taiwan's film industry. Interestingly, Taiwan film actress Jiang Qing (1946- ) is included in the book; however, the mainland China film actress Jiang Qing (1914-1991) is not included in the book because, as Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong’s wife, her later political involvement led the editor to decide not to include her in the book. Includes a name index based on the number of Chinese character strokes in each name, a name index based on Pinyin names in alphabetical order at the beginning of the book, two lists of mainland China and Taiwan film actors and actresses who won awards abroad, and three lists of film actors and actresses who won any of the three domestic film awards in both mainland China and Taiwan.",

            "note": "This is the earliest known academic work on Taiwan film and opera/drama history written by a Taiwanese scholar. The first part of the book, Taiwan Film History (pp. 1-156), contains Chapter 1: Taiwan film during the Japanese occupation period, Chapter 2: Taiwan Film after retrocession, Chapter 3: International cooperation in film production, Chapter 4: Introduction of Taiwan film studios, Chapter 5: Official film advisory and censorship functions, Chapter 6: Non-governmental film organizations, Chapter 7: Film education and workshops, Chapter 8: Film related publications, Chapter 9: Film theory and critics, and Chapter 10: Film industry and theatres.As a groundbreaking work, the author provides a vast amount of firsthand information about Taiwan Film History from 1901-1961, including dates, names, and events related to the Taiwan film. However, as an academic work, it is weak in terms of theoretical analysis and objectivity due to the limits of the overall political and academic environment during the time.Moreover, in 1992, Lee Daw-ming, a Taiwan scholar, found out that Lu had copied part of chapter 3 from Japanese scholar Sai Ichigawa’s work: Ajia eiga no sōzō oyobi kensetsu (Creation and Building of Asian Films) in Chapter 1: “Taiwan film during the Japanese occupation period” within the Taiwan Film History part of his work. Li’s discovery was published in the article: “Dian ying shi ru he lai dao Taiwan de” (How did film come to Taiwan), in Dian ying xin shang (Film Appreciation), No. 9/10, (Sept. /Oct., 1993) p. 107.The preface includes an introduction of the author written by You Mijian.Appendix includes the author’s photo collection (pp. 536-542), an essay on Taiwanese-dialect film (pp. 543-544), and the author’s resume (pp. 576).",

            "note": "Michael Curtin’s text, Playing to the World’s Biggest Audience: The Globalization of Chinese Film and TV examines the shifting dynamics of film and television industries in an era of global connectivity.  While the historical breadth of the project considers the early filmic entertainment industries in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, it focuses on the: “dramatic changes that have occurred since the 1980s with the end of the Cold War, the rise of the World Trade Organization, the modernization policies of the PRC, the end of martial law in Taiwan, the transfer off Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty, the high-tech liberalization of Singapore, the rise of consumer and youth cultures across the regions, and the growing wealth and influence of overseas Chinese in such cities as Vancouver, London, and Kuala Lumpur” (3). This book focuses on the challenge of globalization during the 1990s and early 2000s, confronts the idea that Hollywood hegemony will last indefinitely, and considers globalized Chinese media enterprises that faced a slower pace of expansion in wake of the financial crisis of 1997 and the burst of the dotcom bubble in 2000.  In short, the text discusses how commercial media enterprises -- and at times the text addresses state media in the PRC -- adjusts and shifts to the social and institutional dynamics of the new millennium. Includes a broad historical synopsis of the Shaw Brothers Studio (Chapter 1), a study of Hollywood’s saturation of Taiwan’s film market (Chapter 4), and an account of the current cooperation between mainland China and Taiwan (Chapter 6).Includes Industry Interviews, Notes, Bibliography, and Index.",

            "note": "A comprehensive and objective text on Taiwan film history. Significant achievements of the work include: 1) discovery that the first film shown in Taiwan occurred in 1899, differing from scholars who claim the first screening occurred in 1901, 2) a detailed description of Taiwan film artists’ activities and achievements during the colonial period in both Taiwan and mainland China, 3) covers Taiwan film history from multiple perspectives, 4) the authors maintain an objective stance while approaching politically charged issues such as the Japanese influence on Taiwan cinema, propaganda films in Taiwan, the Nationalist Government’s censorship system, and 5), the text includes important filmographies in some of its chapters. Shortcomings of the work include: 1) poor editing: multiple typos, such as on page 19, when the date of the first feature film made in Taiwan, by the Japanese, is written as 1902 instead of 1922, and chapter 12 starts on p. 331, but in the table of contents it starts on p. 329, 2) poor content organization, for example, chapters 11-21 in volume 2 are not connected cohesively, 3) the text does not contain a complete bibliography, filmography, or indexes, except for inconsistent bibliographical materials included at the end of selected chapters. Thus, it is difficult to recommend this text as reference material, even though it contains important historical information.Includes some bibliographic information at the end of selected chapters.Includes film stills, posters, and photos.",

For example, under the “Taiwan” entry (pp 345-346), the influence of Japan during the colonial period (1895-1945) is not mentioned, while the explanation that Taiwan’s film industry originated in mainland China is, at the least, incomplete. However, the text does provide interesting statistics and factors of the overall picture of Taiwan film industry. For example: at the time of the book's publication there were 450 movie theatres in Taiwan and the cost of producing a film in Taiwan was $100,000, the output of Taiwan’s annual feature films decreased from 250 at the beginning of the 1980s to 150 by the end of the 1980s; also, after Japan severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan in the mid-1970s, Japanese films were banned in Taiwan.

Concludes that the influence of globalization is inevitable, and the pressure of box office success challenges the directors’ integrity and cultural and national values.

The paper provides interviews with French film distributors and points out that “observations of Taiwan distributors and the Taipei Film Commission at Le Marché du Film de Cannes revealed a lack of effort to attract French or European buyers.” In addition, “Taiwan, and Asian Cinema in general, is facing a great opponent as French distributors are now being attracted to more emergent cinemas coming from South America and Africa. Furthermore, interviews are more likely to buy is an art house type of cinema as opposed to the rather commercial type of cinema that regained Taiwanese audience attention since 2008”, including Cape No.7, a hugely successful film in Taiwan’s domestic market.Includes Bibliography, English and Chinese Abstract.",

Yet The City of Sadness was an anomaly, and Ang Lee’s films had good stories; instead, most Taiwan films that garnered international acclaim do not perform well in Taiwan. Thus, the author recommends that Taiwan’s government should not only encourage winning international film festival competitions, but should also encourage the development of interesting narrative content for the Taiwan film market.Includes Bibliography.",

The author points out that Chen Yi’s aim was to manage the film industry with a profit-oriented, loss-control policy, in contrast to the CC Clique's intention to manage the film industry with absolute control, using film as an arm of the government’s propaganda, education, and ideological machinery. Thus, it is apparent that Taiwan’s film industry developed from the beginning as a site of political struggle, dependent on government policy. Consists of five chapters: Chapter 1: Government’s Attitude towards Taiwan Film Industry, Chapter 2: Process of Appropriating the Taiwan Film Industry, Chapter 3:  Factional Struggle in Taiwan Film Industry, Chapter 4: Management and Censorship in Film Industry, and Chapter 5: Profit and Propaganda of Film Industry.Includes Bibliography and official documents.",

Politically, Taiwan’s film industry inherits a legacy of censorship and propaganda; economically, Hollywood films dominate Taiwan’s market after limits on imported foreign films were lifted. As the result of these conditions, and various solutions proposed by film directors, the paper suggests that the government intervene by being more involved in film production and establishing improved film policies.Includes Chinese Abstract, Bibliography, and Appendix (including past import quotas on foreign, and a list of government subsidized domestically produced films from 2002 and 2003).",
