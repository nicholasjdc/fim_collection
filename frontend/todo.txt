current Road Map:
General Requirements:
    - Databse Adjustment
        - Create temporary entry controller
        - test entry controller
        - Create temporary user controller
        - test temp user controller 
        - test both controllers together
        - replace controller
        - check JWT tokens still functional
    -Boolean Search:
        - Backend: 
    - Home Page:
        - Add specific author, subject, and title 
        - add advanced search dropdown
AUTH:
    - only allow SPECIAL authenticated users to edit and delete
    - Allow SUPER SPECIAL users to authenticate other users
        - Make the edit, search, update body a component

Home:
    - Get rid of collapsible for sub-fields
    - Advanced Search collapsible Boolean
        - AND is technically nonfunctional: serves as an internal OR instead
            - Longterm solution: sql migration

Advanced Search:
    - Boolean Search AND/OR/NOT
    - Can use any fields
